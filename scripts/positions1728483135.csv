Since the global financial crisis of 2008, however, we have seen a change of guard. Today, the financial system increasingly revolves around asset managers — mutual fund providers, private equity and venture capital firms, and hedge funds. Although asset managers serve as the agents of (individual and institutional) wealth owners, their control over ‘other people’s money’ makes them the pivotal actors in corporate governance, and in matters of capital allocation more broadly.

Brown University invites applications for a two-year Postdoctoral Research Associate in Political Economy at the Watson Institute for International &amp; Public Affairs. We seek a scholar interested in studying the emerging area of asset manager capitalism from a political economy perspective. An explicit focus on inequalities is an asset, as is experience in working with large-scale financial datasets. We encourage research proposals that seek to answer big questions about the political economy of capitalism.

The successful candidate will be working with Prof. Mark Blyth at the Rhodes Center for International Economics and Finance at Brown University (Providence) and with Prof. Benjamin Braun at the European Institute at the London School of Economics (LSE). This is a two-year appointment. It is expected that the successful candidate will be primarily located at Brown with occasional short-term research stays at LSE.

Ability to conduct and write policy-oriented research, as well as academic research, is essential.

There are no teaching responsibilities.

The selected candidate will devote 50 percent time to projects at the Rhodes Center and 50 percent time to their own research projects.

The Watson Institute is especially interested in qualified candidates who can contribute, through their research, teaching, and/or service, to the diversity and excellence of the academic community.

Reference number: HR-2024/795-2.2.1

Welcome to Linnaeus University! Here you'll meet 2 200 staff members and 40 000 students, all united in following the vision to set knowledge in motion for a sustainable societal development. With us, research and education are conducted with an eye towards the future. Our proximity to the business world, both locally and globally, gives us a wide reach and the ability to create change that makes an impact. All that's needed is a place where ideas have the space to meet and grow. That's what we've created – and you are invited.

Change starts here!

The School of Business and Economics conducts research and education in business administration, economics, statistics, and tourism science. We contribute entrepreneurial thinking and sustainable solutions for complex organizational and societal problems. We take pride in our long tradition of collaboration with the surrounding community. We are accredited through AACSB.

The position is hosted by the [Department of Economics and Statistics (https://lnu.se/en/meet-linnaeus-university/Organisation/school-of-business-and-economics/meet-the-school-of-business-and-economics/economics/)](https://lnu.se/en/meet-linnaeus-university/Organisation/school-of-business-and-economics/meet-the-school-of-business-and-economics/economics/). We offer education at all levels and provide an excellent research environment embedded in Scandinavian and international networks. Our research connects policy and societally relevant issues with the analysis of big data. The department has grown significantly, with a dynamic team of about 25 researchers publishing in top journals and attracting external funds. We are also launching new educational packages in business analytics, financial statistics, and the analysis of policy with big data.

This hiring supports our strategy to build a leading research environment in applied economics and statistics, focusing on socially relevant policy analysis and modern data analysis. We intake a faculty-financed doctoral student in statistics every other year, with an additional position available alongside this professorship. An attractive starting package with additional research time is included.

Subject area for the position: Statistics.

Location: Växjö. Since Linnaeus University is located in both Växjö and Kalmar, travel between these locations may be required.

Employment extent: full-time (100%), permanent.

Start date: 1 May 2025, or by agreement

**Job Responsibilities**

As a professor, you will have overall responsibility for leading and organizing research and teaching activities. A key aspect of this role is to contribute significantly to the development of both the department's and the faculty's research endeavors in the field. This includes formulating future visions for research in the subject area, publishing in leading scientific journals, and actively seeking external research grants. The candidate is expected to actively participate in the development of the teaching portfolio, with a particular focus on modern data analysis related to business statistics, business intelligence, and policy.

**Qualifications**

Eligible for employment as a professor is someone who has demonstrated both scientific and pedagogical expertise. (HF 4 kap 3 §)

Eligible for employment as a professor in statistics is someone who holds a Ph.D. in statistics or an equivalent qualification (e.g., in econometrics), demonstrating both scientific expertise and pedagogical proficiency in the subject.

Additionally, candidates should have proven research skills in developing and applying contemporary statistical analysis methods, such as machine learning, big data analysis, artificial intelligence, or business analytics. They must also be adept at utilizing this knowledge in business, finance, or economic research.

**Assessment Criteria**

The guiding criteria for assessing scientific expertise are that it should be demonstrated through independent, active research according to established national standards, both qualitatively and quantitatively. This places high demands on the scope, originality, breadth, and influence of the scientific output within the subject area.

Pedagogical expertise should be demonstrated through teaching at both undergraduate and graduate levels and pertains to the development, planning, implementation, and evaluation of teaching, supervision, and examination. The pedagogical expertise should reflect a thoughtful approach to students' learning and the instructor's role.

We are seeking an individual with an excellent research background, encompassing both fundamental and applied issues pertinent to the subject of statistics. The ideal candidate should demonstrate expertise in method development within statistics, as well as the adaptation of existing statistical methods and analysis tools for applications in economics, finance and business administration.

It is of great importance that applicants have established themselves as independent researchers at the international level. The following are particularly meritorious for this:

- Demonstrated excellence in research, as evidenced by publications in high-quality, peer-reviewed international journals that clearly exceed the standard of an Associate Professor.
- Obtained research grants in competition with other researchers.
- Demonstrated ability to establish and lead strong research environments.
- Documented national and international research collaboration.
- Collaboration with the surrounding society.

Applicants for the position will also be assessed based on their pedagogical merits and skills. When evaluating pedagogical proficiency, consideration will be given to the ability to:

- Plan, conduct, and evaluate one's own teaching and education at all levels.
- Supervise and examine students at the undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral levels.
- Communicate and implement their pedagogical vision.
- Integrate current research and a scholarly approach into pedagogical work.

Proficiency in English is a requirement, while proficiency in Swedish is not mandatory at the time of employment. However, the candidate should be prepared to take on administrative and pedagogical tasks requiring an understanding and usage of Swedish after three years of employment.

A decision regarding the appointment of a professor is based on a comprehensive assessment of the expertise that constitutes eligibility and the assessment criteria.

**Meritorious**

University pedagogical training of at least 15 higher education credits.

The world is changing. Our values – dignity, prosperity, and democracy – are not. Help us improve German fiscal policy so it better accomplishes those values. We are looking for individuals who share our values and commitment to quality, who have a clear perspective on how the production of knowledge can most effectively support positive change, and who are willing to quantitatively and qualitatively analyze fiscal, economic, and labor market policies and develop proposals for their advancement.

We offer an environment in which you and your ideas can develop into the best version of themselves. Dezernat Zukunft (DZ) will help you improve your skills and grow your public profile, bring your ideas and analyses into public debate – whether through [German](https://zeitung.faz.net/faz/wirtschaft/2021-09-18/2583bc4574c86cbabf76122d6f85d5a2/) and [English](https://www.ft.com/content/1a6db30a-18d1-49bb-bd21-ab839b219f39) daily and weekly newspapers, [publications in magazines for experts and public servants](https://www.wirtschaftsdienst.eu/inhalt/jahr/2021/heft/7/beitrag/die-definition-einer-zukunftsfaehigen-finanzpolitik.html), [podcasts](https://lagedernation.org/podcast/ldn247-spezial-philippa-sigl-gloeckner-volkswirtin-dezernat-zukunft/), [interviews](https://www.n-tv.de/wirtschaft/Derzeit-gibt-es-eigentlich-keine-Inflation-article22958465.html), or on [TV](https://www.zdf.de/comedy/die-anstalt/die-anstalt-vom-12-maerz-2024-100.html).

- **Conduct research**, particularly on growth, production, private and public investment, economic and fiscal policy, and other macroeconomic issues. You will identify the latest research through online searches and conversations, analyze the economic situation, and develop policy proposals. Together with our team, you will decide which projects to tackle and which proposals to develop.
- Develop **robust, useful models and datasets** to quantitatively and qualitatively analyze the macroeconomic and fiscal effects of financial, economic, and labor market policies. Based on your macroeconomic analyses, you will develop proposals for fiscal and economic policy. You will be supported and guided by our experts. These analyses will be a core part of your role with us. With much at stake in our work, rigorous and transparent empirical analyses are essential.
- **Take responsibility for your projects.** You work independently and thoroughly, have a deep interest in public finance, macroeconomics, and politics, and are determined to dig deeper, even if it means going the extra mile. The team will support you whenever necessary, but initiative and responsibility are yours.
- You are **eager to learn something new every day**. Macroeconomic policy is complex. No one comes with all the necessary skills or wisdom (including us!). While we expect you to bring knowledge and opinions, more important are the abilities to expand your knowledge, change your opinions, and balance theory with practical policy to achieve the best possible outcome. We challenge, encourage, and train each other daily to this end.
- You are willing to **interact with representatives from parliaments, governments, academia, and the media**, or to develop in this direction. Our work only succeeds when we engage with these groups, listen, and collaborate.

- **Macro knowledge:** You have solid academic knowledge and one to two years of work experience in at least one of the following areas: macroeconomics, economic policy, fiscal policy, policy analysis, or consulting.
- **Diligent analysis:** You have experience developing and creating reliable analyses (both quantitative and textual). You understand that our analyses and proposals will be scrutinized by the public and work accordingly.
- **Writing talent:** You have excellent German and English skills and are able to write clear, well-structured texts.
- **Team spirit:** You are willing to work as part of a team, to listen, support, and challenge your colleagues.

The world is changing. Our values – dignity, prosperity, and democracy – are not. Help us improve German fiscal policy so it better accomplishes those values. We are looking for individuals who share our values and commitment to quality, who have a clear perspective on how the production of knowledge can most effectively support positive change, and who are willing to quantitatively and qualitatively analyze fiscal, economic, and labor market policies and develop proposals for their advancement.

We offer an environment in which you and your ideas can develop into the best version of themselves. Dezernat Zukunft (DZ) will help you improve your skills and grow your public profile, bring your ideas and analyses into public debate – whether through [German](https://zeitung.faz.net/faz/wirtschaft/2021-09-18/2583bc4574c86cbabf76122d6f85d5a2/) and [English](https://www.ft.com/content/1a6db30a-18d1-49bb-bd21-ab839b219f39) daily and weekly newspapers, [publications in magazines for experts and public servants](https://www.wirtschaftsdienst.eu/inhalt/jahr/2021/heft/7/beitrag/die-definition-einer-zukunftsfaehigen-finanzpolitik.html), [podcasts](https://lagedernation.org/podcast/ldn247-spezial-philippa-sigl-gloeckner-volkswirtin-dezernat-zukunft/), [interviews](https://www.n-tv.de/wirtschaft/Derzeit-gibt-es-eigentlich-keine-Inflation-article22958465.html), or on [TV](https://www.zdf.de/comedy/die-anstalt/die-anstalt-vom-12-maerz-2024-100.html).

You will be part of a think tank that aims at making the world a better place. As Junior Fiscal &amp; Growth Economist in the newly established DZ Growth Lab, you will have the following tasks and responsibilities:

- **Conduct research**, particularly on growth, production, private and public investment, economic and fiscal policy, and other macroeconomic issues. You will identify the latest research through online searches and conversations and analyze the economic situation. You will contribute to our team’s decision on which projects to tackle and which proposals to develop.
- Support the development of **robust, useful models and datasets** to quantitatively and qualitatively analyze the macroeconomic and fiscal effects of financial, economic, and labor market policies. Based on these macroeconomic analyses, you will help develop proposals for fiscal and economic policy. You will be supported and guided by our experts. These analyses will be a core part of your role with us. With much at stake in our work, rigorous and transparent empirical analyses are essential.
- Together with our experts, you will **take responsibility for your projects.** You work independently and thoroughly, have a deep interest in public finance, macroeconomics, and politics, and are determined to dig deeper, even if it means going the extra mile. The team will support you whenever necessary. Showing initiative and taking responsibility are desirable.
- You are **eager to learn something new every day**. Macroeconomic policy is complex. No one comes with all the necessary skills or wisdom (including us!). While we expect you to bring knowledge and opinions, more important are the abilities to expand your knowledge, change your opinions, and balance theory with practical policy to achieve the best possible outcome. We challenge, encourage, and train each other daily to this end.
- You are willing to **interact with representatives from parliaments, governments, academia, and the media**, or to develop in this direction, guided by our experts. Our work only succeeds when we engage with these groups, listen, and collaborate. As Junior Fiscal &amp; Growth Economist, you will learn how these actors operate and how this can be incorporated into our work.

**Your Profile**

- **Orientation:** You share our [values and goals](https://www.dezernatzukunft.org/ueberuns/).
- **Pragmatism, curiosity, and passion:** You have a desire to make a real impact and want to get to the core of things.
- **Passion for numbers and brainpower:** You possess solid quantitative skills, including some experience with modeling in Excel and at least one other common programming language. You also bring qualitative skills.
- **Beginner’s macro knowledge:** You have initial academic knowledge and possibly work experience in at least one of the following areas: macroeconomics, economic policy, fiscal policy, policy analysis, or consulting.
- **Diligent analysis:** You have initial experience developing and creating reliable analyses (both quantitative and textual). You understand that our analyses and proposals will be scrutinized by the public and work accordingly.
- **Writing talent:** You have excellent German and English skills and are able to write clear, well-structured texts.
- **Team spirit:** You are willing to work as part of a team, to listen, support, and challenge your colleagues.

**Why Us?**

**We offer:**

- **Active support** for your development in terms of content, skills, networks, and tasks, including support for training and further education.
- **Regular interaction** with politics, media, academia, and public administration.
- **Good data access** via professional data providers.
- We **pay** according to the public sector collective agreement, pay grade 12. The exact classification depends on your responsibilities and experience.
- A flexible **home-office policy** and an attractive office in a central location.
- And last but not least: a **fantastic team**, meaningful work, and a lot of fun.

**Application process:**

- Apply online [here](https://dezernat-zukunft.jobs.personio.de/job/1732206?language=de&display=de), including a **CV**, a **cover letter** demonstrating your suitability based on the expectations outlined above, and a **text you have written** on a relevant topic (in German or English, maximum 2,000 words, which can be an existing or published text). Please also indicate how you became aware of the job posting. **The application deadline is October 15, 2024.**
- Selected candidates will go through an **assessment test** in the next step, which involves writing a short essay on a current fiscal or economic policy issue.

- In the final step, we will conduct **two interviews**.
- The planned start date is **December 2024**. The exact date is negotiable.

**Are you interested in the role, but not sure if it is right for you or if you would be a good fit for Dezernat Zukunft?**

- **We value diversity and want to increase the diversity of our team.** We welcome all applications regardless of gender, nationality, cultural and social background, religion, belief, age, sexual orientation, or identity.

In France, the Alsace-Moselle region benefits from more generous public health insurance coverage than the rest of the population. According to economic theory (Arrow, 1963, 2001), individuals with the same level of risk aversion therefore have an incentive to choose less private supplementary health insurance. This specific public-private mix of health insurance necessarily affects the way risk pooling is organized between healthy and sick individuals (Franc and Pierre, 2015). The general objectives of the research project are as follows:

(1) To analyze the choice of private health insurance by those insured under the Alsace-Moselle scheme compared to those insured by the public universal scheme.

(2) To measure the impact of the Alsace-Moselle scheme on the use and consumption of health care. Does it provide more equitable access to care than the public universal system for the rest of the French population? How can the private insurance market and the uneven geographical distribution of health care alter the impact of this scheme?

Required skills and qualifications: PhD in Economics (or being in the final stage of a PhD candidature). Quantitative profile (applied economics, econometrics, microeconomics). A specialization in health economics is a plus. Candidates are expected to have expertise in data management using Stata, R or other software for econometric analysis (SAS, Python).
