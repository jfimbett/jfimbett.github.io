Applicant Summary: EL ARGAB Nada (M4I203_ELAR1B76)

Background:
- Moroccan national, currently studying Applied Economics & Financial Engineering at Université Paris Dauphine PSL (L3)
- Strong quantitative foundation: 19/20 in baccalaureate mathematics, coursework in statistics, Python, VBA, and SQL
- Professional experience:
  • Banque Misr internships (2023-2024): Regulatory metrics calculation (LCR/NSFR), financial statement automation, FX position management
  • Developed Monte Carlo simulations and automated ratio calculations in VBA
  • Member of Dauphine AI Association (2024-2025) with exposure to financial applications of AI
- Career goal: Become equity derivatives structurer at top-tier investment bank

----------------------------------------------------------

Question 1 - Statistics (Relates to regulatory metric calculations at Banque Misr)
Q: When analyzing Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB), how would you design a hypothesis test to validate if a bank's economic value volatility stays within regulatory thresholds? Consider both normal and stressed market conditions.

Rationale: Builds on her experience with IRRBB analysis and regulatory compliance work.
Sample Answer: Use a two-tailed t-test comparing observed EVE changes against Basel III thresholds, with separate tests for baseline and stressed scenarios using historical simulation data.

----------------------------------------------------------

Question 2 - Investments (Relates to subordinated debt analysis in 2024 internship)
Q: A bank issues €500M in 10-year non-call 5 subordinated debt with a 7% coupon. If the bank's credit spread widens 150bps 3 years post-issuance, calculate the approximate price impact using duration-convexity adjustment. Assume modified duration of 6.2 and convexity of 0.8.

Rationale: Tests bond valuation skills relevant to her work with subordinated debt instruments.
Sample Answer: Price change ≈ -6.2*1.5 + 0.5*0.8*(1.5)^2 = -9.3% + 0.9% = -8.4% → €458M value.

----------------------------------------------------------

Question 3 - Current Events (Relates to DORA and Basel III exposure)
Q: How might the ECB's June 2024 adjustments to Basel III's output floor impact European banks' competitive position in structured product markets compared to US counterparts?

Rationale: Connects to her regulatory monitoring experience and career interest in structuring.
Sample Answer: The 72.5% output floor could reduce EU banks' risk-weighted asset optimization advantages, potentially narrowing their structured product margins versus US banks still operating under 2023 framework.

----------------------------------------------------------

Question 4 - AI Application (Relates to SQL automation and Dauphine AI Association)
Q: Propose an AI-driven solution to enhance the NSFR calculation process you worked on at Banque Misr, specifically addressing the challenge of classifying "stable" vs "less stable" deposits.

Rationale: Combines her liquidity ratio experience with emerging AI interests.
Sample Answer: Implement a transformer-based NLP model analyzing 5 years of transaction metadata and client communication patterns to dynamically adjust deposit stability coefficients in real-time.
