  <h1>Referee Report</h1>
  <p>Write a referee report for a Working Paper (WP) coauthored by a lead financial economist in Asset Pricing/MacroFinance. I recommend to follow the guidelines
    on how to write a referee report (<a href = "https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/apassalacqua/files/refguidelines_tepe.pdf">here</a>) and (
    <a href = "https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.31.1.231">here</a>
    ).
  </p>
  <p>For examples, look at the program of the  <a href="https://www.nber.org/conferences/asset-pricing-program-meeting-fall-2022"> 
    2022 Asset Pricing Conference </a> organized by the NBER.
