    - We introduce robust option-implied measures of conditional volatility, skewness, and kurtosis based on quantiles and expectiles from S&P 500 weekly options.
    - Our measures are forward-looking, estimated non-parametrically, and derived using a novel robust and arbitrage-free natural smoothing spline technique.
    - The robust option-implied indicators predict U.S. equity risk premium, market volatility, skewness, and kurtosis across different time horizons and outperform historical return-based measures.

## **Social Media and Finance**

### **Social Media as a Bank Run Catalyst**
#### Cookson, Fox, Gil-Bazo, ***Imbet*** and Schiller. 
#### ***Revise and Resubmit (2nd round) Journal of Financial Economics***

- Presented at top conferences including the NBER Summer Institute. 
- Presented to policy makers at the ECB, SRB, and the Bank of France. 
- Highlighted by the FTs, the WSJ, and the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI).

### **Social Media as a Bank Run Catalyst** (summary)

- U.S. regional banks with high pre-existing Twitter exposure experienced 4.3 percentage points greater stock value loss during the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) crisis.
- Banks with both high Twitter exposure and traditional run risks (e.g., uninsured deposits) saw more severe deposit outflows and runs in Q1 2023, independent of other banking or market factors.
- Hourly data showed heightened Twitter attention over a 4-hour window predicted immediate stock declines, particularly for banks already vulnerable to runs.
- Negative Twitter sentiment did not exacerbate bank runs; the critical driver was the volume of attention, not the tone of discussions.
- The crisis was fueled by Twitter activity from tech-sector users (likely SVB depositors) and tweets explicitly referencing "running" or "contagion."

### **Tweeting for Money: Social Media and Mutual Fund Flows**
#### Gil-Bazo and ***Imbet***
#### ***Revise and Resubmit (Minor Revision) Management Science***

- Presented at the FMA Annual Meeting, MFA, and the FMA Consortium on Asset Management. 

---
### **Tweeting for Money: Social Media and Mutual Fund Flows** (summary)

- Asset managers use social media (X/Twitter) as a distinct new channel to attract mutual fund flows.
- Flows respond positively to both the number of posts and their tone.
- This relationship holds even when controlling for traditional marketing efforts, which complement social media activity.
- High-frequency ETF trade data helps isolate the causal effect of tweets on investor decisions.
- The evidence points to social media as an effective persuasion tool rather than a way to reduce search costs, increase attention, or convey performance-relevant information.

## **Offshore Finance and Taxation**

---
#### **The Real Effects of Offshore Data Leaks: Evidence from Private Firms.**
 (Ortiz and Imbet)

***Presented at the American Accounting Association Annual Meeting.*** 

- This paper matches major offshore data leaks to private-firm information in tax havens to assess corporate policies (more than 60,000 european companies).
- Exposed firms increase investment (fixed assets, labor) before leaks but significantly cut back post-leaks.
- Less productive firms and those with faster investment expense deductions benefit most before the leaks.
- Offshore tax evasion boosts domestic investment in less productive firms, but this effect weakens or reverses after the leaks.

#### **Dynamic Contracting and Corporate Tax Strategies**. 
(Imbet, Ortiz, and Tena). 

***Presented at the American Accounting Association Annual Meeting.***

- Develops a dynamic model with moral hazard and random inspections by tax authorities.
- Owners cannot observe either gross profits or the agent’s continuous tax-reduction efforts.
- Risk-averse owners may under-shelter when agent costs or profit volatility are too high.
- In the baseline, the optimal strategy is constant under-reporting, more aggressive with lower agent risk aversion or higher tax rates.
- Under inspection risk, the strategy declines over time, and the agent’s pay includes a risk premium plus a contingent loss if caught.

### **Asset Pricing and Corporate Finance**

### Stroke of a Pen: Investment and Stock Returns under Energy Policy Uncertainty

- Measures energy policy uncertainty by the likelihood of a future presidential energy-related executive order.
- This uncertainty correlates positively with corporate investment and consumption growth, but carries a negative risk price.
- A q-theory framework shows that uncertainty encourages firms to invest in energy-efficient capital, especially if they have strong growth opportunities.
- It amplifies investment differences between growth and value firms by making energy substitution more valuable for growth companies.
- An asset pricing model with an investment factor absorbs cross-sectional returns differences, suggesting uncertainty about energy policies has prompted adoption of energy-efficient capital.
