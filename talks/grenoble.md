# Bank Runs

*What is the business of commercial banks?*

- Commercial Banks are financial intermediaries that take deposits and make loans. By charging a higher interest rate on loans than they pay on deposits, they make a profit.
- Deposits are a very cheap source of funding for banks.
  * They are protected by deposit insurance up to 250,000 USD in the US and 100,000 EUR in the EU.
  * The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in the US and the European Central Bank (ECB), together with their affiliates, are the institutions that provide deposit insurance.

# Bank Runs

*Banks are highly leveraged institutions*

- Since deposits are a very cheap source of funding, banks are highly leveraged institutions. (e.g. Modigliani and Miller, 1958)
- Moreover, banks can become too big to fail. (e.g. Bernanke, 1983) and be bailout by the government.
- This makes banks highly leveraged institutions.

*What if depositors lose confidence in the bank?*

- If depositors lose confidence in the bank, they will withdraw their deposits.
- If the bank does not have enough cash to meet the demand for withdrawals, it will fail.
- It is impossible for a bank to have enough cash to meet the demand for **all** withdrawals since investments are not liquid. (e.g. Diamond and Dybvig, 1983)

# Ironically

The Nobel Prize in economics in 2022 was awarded to Ben Bernanke,
Douglas Diamond and Philip Dybvig for research on bank collapses.

1. "for research on banks and financial crises”
2. From the Nobel Prize website: *This year’s laureates in the Economic
Sciences, Ben Bernanke, Douglas Diamond and Philip Dybvig, have
significantly improved our understanding of the role of banks in the
economy, particularly during financial crises. An important finding in
their research is why avoiding bank collapses is vital.*

# What happened?

What happened? SVB Financial Group (SIVB -60.41% in 10/03/2023) bought some of the safest assets in the world of finance. How could it possibly have failed in two days?

---
# How did we get here?

* SVB Financial is the parent company of Silicon Valley Bank
* Silicon Valley Bank has many startups and venture-capital firms as clients
* During the pandemic, those clients generated a ton of cash that led to a surge in deposits
* SVB ended the first quarter of 2020 with just over $60 billion in total deposits
* That skyrocketed to just shy of $200 billion by the end of the first quarter of 2022
* It was the 16th biggest bank in the US, and the second largest in history to fail

# What did the bank do?

* SVB Financial bought tens of billions of dollars of seemingly safe assets
    * Primarily longer-term U.S. Treasurys and government-backed mortgage securities
* SVB’s securities portfolio rose from about $27 billion in the first quarter of 2020 to around $128 billion by the end of 2021
