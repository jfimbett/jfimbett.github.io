For those traveling outside of Bogota this is an unique excuse to visit Colombia and South america
- Airport: El Dorado 
- Colombia is a safe place for tourists but like in any other latin american country please follow this advice (which you would probably follow it in many european capitals)
    - Use Uber for most transportation
    - Use your common sense, do not walk long distances at night
    - If you call a taxi, ask the hotel reception to call it for you
    - Get a e-sim 
    - Do not receive anything from strangers
    - Try to travel by airplane across cities, Colombia is a very large country. 
    - We will help arrange transportation to and from the wedding since it is outside of Bogota.
