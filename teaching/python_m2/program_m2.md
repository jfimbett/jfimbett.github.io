This is an intermediate course on Python programming. It is designed for students with some prior programming experience. During the course the students and the instructor will develop jointly a python library, covering the steps, methodologies, and standards to produce high quality open-source code. At the end of the course, the students are expected to develop an independent new feature compatible with the project.
