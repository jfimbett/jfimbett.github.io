# Exercise 1: Temperature conversion (20 minutes)

Write a program that converts from any of the following temperature units to any of the others: Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The program should ask the user for the temperature and the unit of the temperature, and then ask the user for the unit to which the temperature should be converted. The program should then display the converted temperature. You can interact with the user using the `InputBox` function or directly in the excel sheet.

## Some formulas 

- Celsius to Fahrenheit: $F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32$
- Celsius to Kelvin: $K = C + 273.15$

# Exercise 2: Prime numbers (20 minutes)

Write a program that asks the user for a number and then displays whether the number is prime or not. A prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself. You can use the modulo operator in VBA (`mod`) to check if a number is divisible by another number.
